A script that can parse a fixed length field in Relativity.

For example, if Production Attach Range for a document is sth like “ABC0001 – ABC0004”, the result will be populating DocFamilyID field with “BC0001 “ which parses from second character (“B”) for 7 characters (how many aka length).
You can isolate and run the script against only a subset of documents by pointing to a saved search.
